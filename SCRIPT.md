Here's the clean, intuitive interface I built using Streamlit. The main panel is where we'll see our results, and the sidebar contains all our configuration options.

## Configuration Demo (30 seconds)

**[Navigate to the sidebar]**

First, let's set up our scraping parameters:

1. I'll enter a target URL - let's use openai.com as an example
2. For crawling options, we'll set a depth of 2 pages and respect robots.txt
3. For filtering, I want leads that contain words like "AI" or "technology" 
4. I'll exclude terms like "login" or "sign up"
5. We can also set a minimum quality threshold with this slider

You can save these settings for future use or load previous configurations.
